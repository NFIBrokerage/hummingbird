## Reporting a Vulnerability

We have no official disclosure policy.  However, this should be a workable default.

If you: 
 - create an issue in this repository with private contact information

A maintainer should: 
 - publicly respond to the issue as acknowledged within 30 days
 - create a private discussion to resolve and coordinate release
 - maintainer will announce progress on public issue
 - thank the submitter on the README.md
